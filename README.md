<br />
What does it do? Extract key keywords from any of article, blog, or document by simply pasting them into the text box. <br />
This project was made possible using Open-AI's API. - Thank you open ai :)
<br />
<br />
Due to Open-Ai's API limit you will have to use your own api key to see it work.
<br />
<br />
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Click the link and sign in/sign up. https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
2. Create an API key and paste it into the .env and then run or re-run "npm run dev".
3. Paste some text into the text box (recommend not pasting a lot of text since it will use up your Open-Ai API usage).
4. A Pop up will appear, and you can see the keywords extracted from your text input.
<br />
Feel free to download this and mess around with it. The API is fairly straight forward and super interesting.
